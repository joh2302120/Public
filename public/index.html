     <h2>Running Out Of Everything Always</h2> 
     <p>My idea for a website would be a collection of common recipe substitutes if someone runs out of eggs. Replace one egg with: (1 teaspoon of baking soda, one tablespoon of vinegar), (1/4 cup of applesauce), (1/4 cup yogurt), (Whirl 1/4 cup silken tofu in a blender, adding water until smooth), (1/4 cup mashed banana), (Stir together one tablespoon ground flaxseed in 3 tablespoons water until thick and gelatinous).</p>

     <p>I would also list some simple spice blend recipes. Pumpkin Spice Recipe: 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg, ¼ teaspoon ground ginger,⅛ teaspoon ground cloves. This is a pretty easy recipe to make if you have a good selection of spices at home and want to make something fall themed.</p>
